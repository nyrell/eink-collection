Tools, themes and instructions for e-ink monitors under Linux and KDE

This is a collection of tools, themes and notes that I have collected as I try to improve my experience with e-ink monitors under Linux. The monitors that I am experimenting with are:

* Dasung Paperlike 13K (Color), 13.3" 37Hz, 3200x2400
* Dasung Paperlike 13.3 HD-F (B/W), 13.3", 2200x1650

Since I had to send the B/W monitor back for repairs and just got it back, I have spent most time on the color monitor.


## Contents of this repository

### bin/monitor.sh

This is a script I use to setup the monitor(s) on KDE Plasma 5. I hope that Plasma 6 will make it unnecessary.

### python/generate_colorscheme_image/

A python script to generate PNG images of colorschemes for testing. Some generated images are saved here too.
